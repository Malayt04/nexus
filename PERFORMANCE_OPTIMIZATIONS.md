# Nexus AI Performance Optimizations

## Overview
Implemented optimizations to reduce AI response latency from 60+ seconds to 10-20 seconds target.

## 1. Prompt Optimization
- **Reduced system prompt size by ~75%**
- Eliminated verbose explanations and redundant instructions
- Streamlined to essential capabilities and guidelines only
- From ~4000 characters to ~1000 characters

## 2. History Management
- **Limited conversation history to last 4 messages (2 exchanges)**
- Reduced from 10 messages to 4 messages sent to AI
- Trimmed individual messages to 1000 characters max
- Backend further limits to 6 messages for processing

## 3. Parallel Processing
- **Parallelized media processing** (screenshots and file attachments)
- **Asynchronous chat saving** - doesn't block AI response
- **Non-blocking title generation** - happens in background

## 4. Resource Optimization
- **Reduced screenshot resolution** from 1920x1080 to 1280x720
- **Limited web search results** from 5 to 3 results
- **Function call limits** - maximum 3 tool calls per request
- **Timeouts added** for all external operations

## 5. Global Timeout
- **25-second hard timeout** for entire AI invocation
- Prevents hanging requests that exceed acceptable response time
- Provides clear error message for timeout scenarios

## 6. UI Optimizations
- **Immediate UI feedback** - loading states update instantly
- **Optimistic updates** - user messages appear immediately
- **Reduced state updates** - minimize unnecessary re-renders
- **Async background operations** - chat saving and title generation

## 7. Backend Improvements
- **Tool execution timeouts** - 10s for commands, 8s for web search
- **Error handling** - graceful fallbacks for failed operations
- **Efficient data structures** - reduced memory usage

## 8. Response Length Optimization
- **Enforced concise responses** - AI instructed to keep responses short and crisp
- **Context-appropriate length** - Simple greetings: 1-2 words, general questions: 1-2 sentences
- **Specific examples provided** - Clear guidance on expected response lengths
- **Reduced token usage** - Shorter responses = faster processing and lower costs

## Expected Performance Impact
- **Target response time**: 10-20 seconds for most queries
- **Reduced data transfer**: ~60% less data sent to AI
- **Shorter AI responses**: 70-80% reduction in response length for simple queries
- **Faster UI responses**: Immediate feedback and loading states
- **Better error handling**: Clear timeout messages and recovery
- **Lower token costs**: Significantly reduced output token usage

## Monitoring
- Console logs for AI tool calls and timing
- Error tracking for timeout scenarios
- Performance metrics for optimization validation
